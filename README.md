Hi, I'm Tim. 

I have a background in conservation biology and am currently pursuing an M.S. in GIS. 
My goal is to use conservation planning to develop solutions that protect biodiversity while promoting human health and happiness. 

My main interests are in sustainable development, conservation, and geospatial analysis.
